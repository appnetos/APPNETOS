The mailer offers other apps the possibility to send emails.
The APPNET OS Mailer is an integrated system app. The settings of the mailer are fixed in the administrator area. Mailboxes can be created here to send e-mails.
This app allows third-party apps to send messages through the mailboxes. The mailboxes must be assigned to the apps, usually through the Administrator Settings app.
The APPNET OS Mailer has an advanced firewall that blocks excessive access and robots. IP addresses and email addresses can be permanently blocked or allowed. A log informs you about sent or blocked emails.
In addition, the mailer has a widget that informs you about sent and blocked emails in your dashboard.
The mailer must be installed in the CMS area in front of the apps. We do not recommend using the mailer statically.
