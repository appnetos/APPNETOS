Carousel is multilingual. A separate image can be used for each language. If the image does not exist for a language, the image of the default language is loaded. If this does not exist, the global image is loaded. The images can be linked. A full link or SEO URI can be used for this purpose. The images should be the same height. The width should be at least the width of the output of the app. ",
