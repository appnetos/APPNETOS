APPNET OS Container End is an important system app.
The component terminates a responsive container and forces the system to build a new one.
If this app is placed between multiple container apps, a separate container is created for each app.
This makes the app an important component of the system.
The app can be installed and used as often as desired.

The app is a standard system component and is present in every APPNET OS version.
If the app is not available or lost, it can be downloaded or renewed here free of charge at any time.
